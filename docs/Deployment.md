# Deployment Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the deployment strategy for the Kelick HR Platform.

### Architecture

- Frontend: React + Vite (Static Site)
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
- File Storage: Supabase Storage

### Deployment Process

1. **Build Process**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   - Outputs static files to `dist/`
   - Includes environment variable substitution
   - Optimizes assets and bundles

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Production environment variables set in Netlify
   - Supabase project configuration
   - Database migrations run automatically

3. **Deployment Steps**
   - Push to main branch triggers deployment
   - Netlify builds and deploys frontend
   - Database migrations run if needed

### Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Stored securely in Netlify
   - Never committed to repository
   - Separate keys for development/production

2. **Database Security**
   - Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
   - Proper role-based access control
   - Regular security audits

3. **API Security**
   - CORS configured properly
   - Rate limiting enabled
   - Request validation

### Monitoring & Maintenance

1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Netlify Analytics
   - Supabase Dashboard
   - Error tracking

2. **Database Maintenance**
   - Regular backups
   - Performance optimization
   - Index maintenance

3. **Updates & Patches**
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Security patches
   - Feature deployments

### Rollback Strategy

1. **Frontend Rollback**
   - Netlify deploy rollback
   - Previous deployment restoration
   - DNS updates if needed

2. **Database Rollback**
   - Point-in-time recovery
   - Migration reversions
   - Data backups

### CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Continuous Integration**
   - Run tests
   - Lint code
   - Type checking
   - Build verification

2. **Continuous Deployment**
   - Automated deployments
   - Environment promotion
   - Deployment verification

### Scaling Strategy

1. **Frontend Scaling**
   - CDN distribution
   - Asset optimization
   - Caching strategy

2. **Database Scaling**
   - Connection pooling
   - Query optimization
   - Index strategy

### Emergency Procedures

1. **Incident Response**
   - Contact procedures
   - Escalation path
   - Recovery steps

2. **Backup Recovery**
   - Backup verification
   - Recovery testing
   - Data integrity checks
